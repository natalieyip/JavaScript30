1. map will always return the same amount you give it unlike filter
2. reduce is similar to a for loop where you set an index and run a for loop and you continue to add to the total
   ex. total = 0;
      for( var i = 0; i < inventors.length; i++) {
        total += inventors[i].year
      }
3. console.table gives you a nice table
4. Array.from or the spread operator [...category.querySelectorAll('a')] gives you back an array from a nodelist.
